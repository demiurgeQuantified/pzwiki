Frogs and wild eggs are also updated to be usable in recipes, but are now perishable (as they should be). Herbs are still non-perishable because they can theoretically be usable when dried. Also adds the ability to boil ripped sheets into sterilized rags: recipe needs 10 ripped sheets + pot of water, cook on a heat source until \"clean\" (no unhappy), then remove the rags from the pot. And now you can also preserve strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries by jarring (needs empty jars, jar lids, sugar and water, then cook the jars). Updated 4/26/16 for build 34."

They'll always be subpar compared to multiplayer, but they can still add a lot to the game.This is an extension of nolanritchie's Superb Survivors. I've optimized it to reduce the performance impact, and added some balance changes and fixes to the AI routines to behave better. Also includes bugfixes for most of the in-game errors I've encountered, and improved compatibility with Gunfighter and Brita's.You must have Superb Survivors activated first before activating this mod. Build 41 is required.It is suggested that you start a new save when enabling this mod. If you add it to an existing save with Superb Survivors, it will delete any Survivors from that game.Changes from Superb Survivors are too numerous to list, but include:* Fixed compalitibility issues with Brita's mods and added guns & armor to NPC spawn tables* Prevent NPCs from trying to open locked windows forever* Don't consider spoons and forks to be proper weapons* Better food prioritization (they'll eat fresh cooked food before unopened cans, etc.)* Gender-specific outfits* Better outfit randomization* Improved search algorithm to more efficiently find nearby items* Don't keep looking for food when they just checked and found none* Backpacks are properly equipped now* NPCs now have perks* Lots of null reference errors fixed (prevents scary red box numbers)* More likely to run away when unarmed* Survivors now wash themselves* \"Safe Base\" setting now works properly* Fix \"stair deaths\" in many cases (it still seems to happen sometimes, but should be less frequent now)* Better handling of stuck survivors* Cannibalism* Smarter reloading (survivors will only reload when it's safe or their gun is completely empty)* Backpack spawn is now based on time passed (only small packs in the beginning, larger packs possible as game goes on)* Fixed bug with groups that resulted in Survivors getting assigned to the wrong group* Guard order now sends them to the guard area instead of standing still* Preset spawns get real names* Remove zombies immediately surrounding new survivor spawns (so they don't get eaten right away)* Prison start fixes with key and guard ammo spawns* New base task system prioritizes jobs based on skill and number already doing it* Survivors will do some jobs in the rain if they're not already wet* New clean inventory task* Wild survivors will now start their own bases and barricade* Defaults: weapons spawn rate increased, presets disabled, safe base on* New \"Companion\" role added when directed to \"Follow\" so they'll stay with you even in base* Food and weapon gifts have increased relationship boost* Added a debug command to spawn trained soldiers* Can now rename survivors* Added more details to info window* Give up on entering windowless buildings* Chop wood task will now use all possible axe types (including stone axe)* Broken axes are returned to the tool storage* Survivors won't take off clothing when cleaning inventory* Fixed infinite dog food eating bug* Farmers won't plant new crops, will only water, harvest, and replant the same crop* Survivors will go to the forage area to forage* Reduced search range to gather wood* Lock door sound error* Avoid getting stuck in loops when trying to loot unreachable areasCredits:nolanritchie: for the amazing foundation they laid in the Superb Survivors mod.Arsenal[26]-DontUse2SilencerMods: GunFighter mod compatibility code.Fox: For testing and brainstorming ideas.EpiKality: Brita's compatibility and item spawns.Sardas: NPC Damage and run speed fixes for 41.51+ compatibility."

In general, revolvers and shotguns are easy to use for characters with a low skill level in firearms, but do not gain much from a high level user. This makes them good for training a characters level if they did not spec into guns at all. Rifles are a good middle ground, where they are somewhat easy for low to mid level characters, but also gain a lot from high levels in shooting. Semi automatic handguns are difficult for low level shooting characters, but become one of the best options at high shooting levels, thanks to a low sound radius, low weight, and greater ability to be used while moving.                                                                                                                                                                            ~~~Check the steam page for a more in depth changelog for each gun!"

		"desc": "Dangalong's Cure Wild Meat mod adds the ability to cure meat from wild animals and fish into jerky-like food items with a long shelf-life, which are ready-to-eat and can also be used in cooking. Level 5 Cooking is required for this valuable skill. Curing meat reduces the nutrition of the original cut slightly and adds +10 thirst when eaten alone, but will stay good for 60-90 days. After salting the meat must then be cooked to become safe to eat as well as fully cured. Cooking time for curing salted meat is considerably longer than for normal food items. Recipes only work on vanilla wild animals and fish for now, except rabbits from UngratefulDead's Hunting mod, and Rabbit Cutlets from my Rabbit Pelt Tanning mod. The salting recipe is also compatible with the salt item gained from Deadend's Canning Mod as well as the base salt. Made compatible with build 34 nutrition system. Added curing of frog meat. Updated 4/30/16."
